To get the app running you will need to create a .env file in the root of the project with the following:

```
REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Things to improve given more time:

- Displaying the DailyWeatherDetailed data in a format consistent to the rest of the project.

- If no data in DailyWeatherDetailed then possibly redirect to a 404 page or homepage with an error toast/message.

- Task 4 failed due to the degree symbol, I moved onto the next task given the time constraints.

- Write tests on functions inside /utils to ensure they would work as expected with various inputs.
